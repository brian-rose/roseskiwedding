The tale of Laura and Brian, in a few silly pictures. More to come!

## We met in choir!

We first met in 2019 at the [Rock Voices](https://rockvoices.com) community choir. We still sing together with this group!

## Laura moved in at a weird time!

Laura first moved in with the Roses smack in the middle of a massive house renovation. Here we are fireside with the partially-built new kitchen island in the background.

## Work!

Laura is a [veterinary neurologist](https://www.uvsonline.com/doctors/laura-krzykowski/). Brian is a [professor of climate science](https://brian-rose.github.io). It keeps us busy.
