## We met in choir!

We first met in 2019 at the [Rock Voices](https://rockvoices.com) community choir. We still sing together with this group!

## Laura moved in at a weird time!

Laura first moved in with the Roses smack in the middle of a massive house renovation. Here we are fireside with the partially-built new kitchen island in the background.
