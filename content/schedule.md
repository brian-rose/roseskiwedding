## Fun stuff in the area

_These are a few of our favorite things..._

* Hiking, amazing views, and geological history at [Thacher State Park](https://parks.ny.gov/parks/128/)
* The [New York State Museum](http://www.nysm.nysed.gov) in downtown Albany is very good and has free admission! 
* [The Egg](http://www.theegg.org/about) at the Empire State Plaza is arguable the coolest concert hall you'll ever find.
* [Lark Street](https://www.albany.com/hotspot/lark-street/) is Albany's arts and entertainment hub.
* [Washington Park](https://www.albany.org/listing/washington-park/2361/) is Albany's Olmsted-designed "Central Park", great for strolling. It's possible you'll catch some blooms leftover from the [Albany Tulip Festival](https://518bitesandsights.com/event/albany-tulip-festival-2023/)
* Nearby city of [Troy](https://www.downtowntroy.org) has a vibrant historic downtown 
* You're really into navigable waterways, right? Good! Check out the famous [Waterford Flight of Locks](https://www.mohawktowpath.org/2011/09/06/waterfordflight/) at the eastern terminus of the Erie Canal. The greatest vertical lift in the shortest distance of any canal system in the world!
  - Check out [Upstate Kayak Rentals](https://upstatekayakrentals.com/self-serving-rentals--charters.html) for a one-way rental so you can actually paddle the flight of locks yourself! (We did it, and it was awesome)
* Farmers markets on Saturday morning:
  - The [Delmar Farmers Market](http://www.delmarmarket.org) is right in our neighborhood and has all our favorite veggie growers and cheese makers. Saturday 9 am - 1 pm.
  - The [Troy Waterfront Farmers Market](https://www.troymarket.org) is even larger and they probably have great cheese too.
* Good beer in the area:
  - [The Real McCoy](http://www.therealmccoybeerco.com), fun rustic taproom in Delmar with occasional live music
  - [The Warbler Brewery](https://www.warblerbrewery.com/warbler-home), another small brewer and taproom in Delmar
  - [Albany Pump Station](https://www.evansale.com) in downtown Albany
  - [Brown's Brewing](https://www.brownsbrewing.com) in downtown Troy
  - [Rare Form Brewing](https://www.rareformbrewing.com) in downtown Troy
