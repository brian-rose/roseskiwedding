Hello everyone!

Wedding weekend is fast approaching, and we wanted to send out a few last-minute reminders:

- Ceremony starts at 4:30 pm on Saturday
    - we recommend arriving at the venue around 4-4:15 so there is time to park and make your way to the ceremony location. 
    - Address for Pond Hill Pavilion is 20 Brownrigg Road, Feura Bush NY, 12067
- Weather is looking great for the weekend, so plans for the Saturday evening patio after-party and Sunday patio brunch are on! More details are on our website <https://roseski.org> but a few highlights:
    - Our address is 39 Alden Court, Delmar, NY 12054
    - When arriving at our house, please __park on the odd side of the street__ so as not to block traffic. 
    - If you are able, we would also encourage you to park on adjacent streets and walk over to decrease congestion. 
    - Follow the lighted path on the right side of the house - this will take you directly back to the patio. 
- For those who RSVP'd with dietary restrictions: 
    - Everything that isn't obviously bread (i.e. dinner rolls, cupcakes) should be gluten-free at the buffet dinner. 
    - If you requested a vegan or vegetarian meal, first grab what you like from the buffet, and then identify yourself to the catering staff and they will bring out an entree for you.

We are so looking forward to this weekend and can't wait to see everyone soon!

Love,
Laura & Brian.
