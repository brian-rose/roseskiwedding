The Four Points has room options with 1 King or 2 Queen beds. There's a restaurant and bar onsite, as well as fitness center and pool. 

The hotel is easy to get to, right off the intersection of I-87 and I-787. It's an [easy 15 minute drive](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Four+Points+by+Sheraton+Albany,+3+Mount+Hope+Way,+Albany,+NY+12202/Pond+Hill+Pavilion+Albany,+Brownrigg+Rd,+Feura+Bush,+NY/@42.6034892,-73.906698,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89de0b81f8f9d449:0x689acf402aa90bf4!2m2!1d-73.7745438!2d42.6295528!1m5!1m1!1s0x89dddf38e2f2f997:0x44fa69c0b445368f!2m2!1d-73.8985671!2d42.5872421!3e0) from the hotel to [Pond Hill Pavilion](https://pondhillpavilion.com) for the wedding and reception -- and even shorter drive to our house for the morning-after brunch!
