## We don't have a traditional wedding gift registry

We are looking forward to seeing and celebrating with each one of you this May. We are delighted to have you as a part of our wedding weekend! **While your attendance is gift enough (really and truly)**, we have had several questions about a gift registry. 

After moving in together, we realized that we have accumulated a lot of stuff combining two households. So rather than add to our large collection of silverware and wine glasses, we thought that a honeymoon registry would be perfect! We love traveling together and experiencing new cultures and food, and are so excited to honeymoon someplace neither one of us has ever been before, so we can experience it for the first time together.

_We are going to Portugal!!_

If you would like to offer us a gift, we suggest a small monetary donation toward our travel plans. We are so grateful that you can help us create honeymoon memories that will last a lifetime. We have tons of amazing things planned for our trip as you will see when you check out the details. 

Much love,

Laura & Brian

## Our itinerary 

We depart Sunday afternoon, and will be flying overnight from Newark to Porto.

First we spend 3 days in Porto (a coastal city in northwest Portugal). We will be staying in a boutique hotel that was revitalized from a 200 year old stationary factory.

We will spend time visiting museums and exploring the city’s architecture, which is known for its intricate tilework.

Porto is also known for its port, so we will be taking a day trip to visit vineyards in the Douro valley.
